Adds a simple lightbox to default Gutenberg gallery.

== Description ==

In the default Gutenberg gallery, whenever you click a gallery image, you either navigate to another page and see the linked image or you cannot click and see a bigger version of the image at all.

This plugin shows Gutenberg gallery images in a lightbox on the same page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload to the plugins directory and activate.
2. No extra steps or setup is needed.
3. You can easily style your lightbox in your own CSS file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you navigate to other gallery images, once you are in the lightbox? =

Not yet. We plan to add it in the near future.

== Screenshots ==

1. A standard Gutenberg gallery.
2. A gallery image visible in the lightbox.
